# Knight Quest
#### Video Demo:  <(https://youtu.be/_qWPDGMCBrs)>

#### Knight Quest uses a range of different resources to create the atmosphere of a medieval supernatural mystery. 

### Such resources and their uses include:
#### The usage of the pygame module for background music. (the music is from _Silent Hill 2 Remake_)
While usually used for rendering graphics, I have used the pygame module only for its mixer module, which has the ability
to change 

-> Termcolor module for colored text for additional effect.

-> The Time module to pause between texts and allowing the player to read easily. (Also for dramatic effect at times)

-> ASCII art to portray characters when you talk to them and locations when you travel to them.

The main gameplay is akin to a visual novel in terminal, where there are choices between what to do at times, 
and at the end a confrontation with the **Big Bad** that you are searching for. 

### KnightQuest.py
One for the player and one for the NPCs (Non Playable Characters) that you talk to.
The player has the ability to travel to different locations and approach that location's NPC for more information.
While the NPCs have a bond which dictates which dialogue that they will speak to you. The bond increases after certain
requirements are met, until then they will repeat a single dialogue back to you, similar to NPCs in other games. 
Essentially to create a smooth flow of the story, I made it so that different NPCs have small parts of the whole truth,
after which you have to piece together the mystery.
